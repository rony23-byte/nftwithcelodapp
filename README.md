  This is a  project that demonstrates the  basic Hardhat use case. I wrote a simple ERC721 contract , a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts  Try running some of the following tasks:  ```shell npx hardhat accounts npx hardhat compile npx hardhat clean npx hardhat test npx hardhat node node scripts/sample-script.js npx hardhat help ```
